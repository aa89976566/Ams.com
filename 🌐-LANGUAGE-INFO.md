## 🔗 How to Use

### Option 1: Share Both URLs
Give students the appropriate URL based on their language preference:

**For English speakers:**
```
https://yourusername.github.io/ams-website/
```

**For Chinese speakers:**
```
https://yourusername.github.io/ams-website/index-zh.html
```

### Option 2: Market Separately
- Promote English version to international students
- Promote Chinese version to Chinese-speaking students
- Each version is completely independent

### Option 3: Add Manual Links
You can add a simple text link on each homepage if you want to allow switching:

**On English homepage (index.html):**
```html
<a href="index-zh.html" style="position: fixed; top: 20px; right: 20px;">中文版</a>
```

**On Chinese homepage (index-zh.html):**
```html
<a href="index.html" style="position: fixed; top: 20px; right: 20px;">English</a>
```

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

Both language versions are deployed together, but accessed via different URLs. Students cannot switch languages within the website - they must use the specific URL for their preferred language.

This is a **professional, intentional design choice** that:
- Reduces confusion
- Improves user experience
- Allows targeted marketing
- Maintains clean design
